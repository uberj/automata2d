Game of life in Java
====================

This exercise was meant to be a Java refresher. This implementation is likely over-engineered but the point of writing it was to remember:
* Java class hierarchies (including abstract classes)
* Java interfaces
* Java's iterator pattern
* How nice it is to have an IDE write code for you
* How nice it is to use a strongly typed language
* How functional concepts don't translate very well to Java (maybe Java 8 lambdas would help here)
